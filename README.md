[Piggy] (https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/piggy-bank-icon-on-white-background-vector-id930765408?s=612x612)



## Overview and Origin 

* Spriggy 
1. The Original name according to a 2015 award that the company recieved was Piggy.  More background on this will be provided in the overview section [^1]



* Incorporation Date 
1. Founded in 2015, by the two original, and current founders, or directors.  More on them later, however basically they knew each other from having worked the derivatives desk together at Citi.  
* Founders of the Company are : Mario Hasanakos and Alex Badran.  Their backgrounds were in derivatives trading with Citigroup, amongst other experience., including education.  Mario focuses on finance and strategy, letting Alex manage product and R&D. 
* How the idea for the company came about: The origins of the idea actually were formed by a wish to build a transactional banking product for millenials as they were in the demographic and wanted to solve this personally and for others like them [^2]. <embed src="file:///C:/Users/jimp/Downloads/Millenials.pdf" type="application/pdf"> This was then revised as they found out quite early that many of their demographic are already quite set in their ways based on when financial literacy views and ideals become entrenched.  This caused them to begin discussions with kids and more importantly their families as a way to get in early before habits, views, ideas etc become entrenched. [^3].  This then was the catalyst for them to launch an MVP which was a prepaid debit card for younger, ie under 18 year olds, and this was matched with an app utilised by both parent and child to add funds, and track transactions initially. [^4]


* How is the company funded?  Amount of Funding received 
1. Original funds were $300,000 in 2015.  H2 Ventures an early stage VC firm was involved. [^5]
2. Second round of funds in August of 2017 saw the founders raise $2.5 Million led by Perle Ventures and Alium Capital, so this was a venture capital round and there were other undisclosed investors as well. [^6]
At that time the number of users in Spriggy was around 35,000. 
3. August 2018 say a further round of raising and largest of which was from Grok Ventures, a company led by Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon- Brookes.  At this time some of the original investors also were involved, and it was disclosed at that time by Alex Badran one of the co founders that Spriggy had raised $6 Million to date. [^7]
4. 2019 saw other investors including a closed end fund: Perennial Private to Public Opportunities fund provide additional funds, and this figure is an undisclosed amount.  [^8]
5. July/Aug 2021 saw NAB Ventures lead a $35 Million funding investment.  The focus of this large injection of capital was to treble its team that sat at 35 at the time, and expand the mobile app and personalised prepaid card for young people. It was at this time that it was estimated that the number of app users totaled more than 500k or closer to 550k. In 2020 just under 19.3% of the population were under 14 years, and so in a country the size of 25.7 Million this means that Spriggy had approximately 9-10% of it's target market.  Obviously though many of the owners of this app will  also be in older demographics, ie 30 - 50 year old range due to the fact that they best represent the likely demographic of parents of the intended "client"of the app.  [^9] <embed src="file:///C:/Users/jimp/Downloads/Money.pdf" type="application/pdf">

## Business Activities 

* The specific financial problem the company is trying to solve:  Originally this was about addressing transactional needs of families especially ones with school age children, ie over 8 years olds and giving parents opportunity to educate children on money and encourage them with savings goals. 
1.  2017 - at this stage Spriggy referred to themselves as an independent tech and education company, giving parents the tools to teach children about money in digital age. 
2. The founders aimed to find a simpler way for parents to give their kids pocket money, and teach them about money in the digital age
* Who is the company's intended customer? 
1. Aged between 8 - 18 Spriggy is targeted at this demographic due to wanting to get in early with them and their parents to ensure healthy, and enriching attitudes about money and financial literacy is gained.  Obviously what goes hand in hand with this is the fact that the parents of the younger of this demographic also are involved in the early stages of set up and discussions around money, as Spriggy is an education tool that fosters this.  Any information available about Market size of this set of customers? 
1. This has been provided previously in point 5 above in the section of funding rounds, and suffice to say that this still only represents around 2-3% of the total demograpic of both the younger clientele, 8 - 18 and their parents.  Also, around 90% of the original downloaders of this app were Mother's indicating the hands on roll that mother's often play in a child's education and development in this area [^10] 
2.  Since Sept 2018 the demographic expanded further due to customer demand and Spriggy made itself available to 6 year olds and up. [^11] 
* The solution offers what compared to their customers?  
1. One of Spriggy's main competitors is Zaap, and as Zaap is newer to the marketplace it doesnt have as much to offer, with the huge advantage for Spriggy is that it offers more real world solution to the concept of earning money.  To this end Spriggy allows parents to set up jobs that their children can do to earn money, so that it demonstrates the link between working and earning money and watching your money grow.  Zaap allows one to set savings goals, without having this digital feature. [^12]
2.  As to whether others will offer this, is a story yet to unfold.  Zaap in comparison seems to be cheaper and so may be a trade off between cost and benefits.  Is this something that the competitors don't or can't offer? As for Zaap they do offer instant transfer of money to solve problems like not having money for train, or transport, however they also have more card colour choices and a wearable feature that Spriggy doesnt have.  What is the unfair advantage that they utilise?
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?  
1. Spriggy acts as an agent of Indue, a Toowong based deposit taking institution.  This is necessary since Spriggy has not taken the step to get a banking license or deposit taking license, which is offered by Indue a long standing company with more than 50 years experience in payment, card, and credit fraud solutions, to name a few. 
2. In a recent upgrade to the system, Spriggy has begun to enhance the Job section of Spriggy where parents typically assign jobs/chores to children to help them to earn money, and this can now be more flexible then previously.  Also, parents can now transfer cents to spriggy, not just dollars. 
3.  JQuery, HTML5, Google Analytics Viewport Meta, SPF among the 77 technologies that they utilise for their app & website [^13] technology in the delivery of their cards, and secure deposit and transaction offerings for families.  

## Landscape 

* The Domain of the financial industry that Spriggy operates in: Spriggy operates in the payments domain and yet they cross over into savings, and financial literacy as well as they develop. 
*  Major trends and the innovations of this domain over the last 5- 10 years
1.  Buy now, Pay later has become big business, and for really the last 4-5 years, this has come out of nowhere; 
2. Businesses have been shifting to adopt multi channel commerce strategies, so they can reach customers anywhere. Coupled with that in australia is a major shift away from old world ways of doing things.  This is evidenced by the fact that Victorian public schools since late 2020, have banned the use of school banking programs such as CBA dollarmites, since it has failed to show that the programs teaches students good financial habits that last into adult life. [^14]
3.  This week, I heard a presentation from a lead fund manager of Montague investments sharing the trends of smaller players adopting blockchain, and other more versatile, and efficient technologies and how this has shaped their investment decisions away from larger finance/banking/insurance to smaller more nimble players, this trend has been emerging for the past 4- 5 years.  
4.  Over half of consumers consider themselves more digital than ever before, and 39% of consumers shop from their mobile daily.[^15]
* Other major companies in this domain:
1. Zaap has already been mentioned with some of its benefits and short-comings 
2. Revolut is a relatively now player in Australia but has a worldwide offering and has been around for quite some time.  Budgeting, and digital money and offerings for under 18's means this is a potential big competitor for Spriggy although it has only really been launched in Australia since late 2020. 

## Results 
* What has been the business impact of Spriggy so far? 
1.  Solid steady growth and take up of its app and website based on a simple structure of payment of $30 per year.  With near 550,000 users of its app this means that approximately $16 Million of revenue per annum could be achieved, but as they are not a listed company this is hard to determine.  Most likely this overstates matters however for the past couple of years it is understood that they have some cash accumulated in the business. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?
1. Traffic - currently Spriggy has monthly visit of nearly 25,000 to its site, which has been relatively consistent. [^16] 95% of these come from Australia 
2.  Take up by schools.  Spriggy schools offers online school canteen ordering, another new feature. Very simple feature with fees being 1% of transaction fees. 
*How is Spriggy comparing to competitors in this same domain?
1. Spriggy has taken the lead to grow it's offering into schools right at a time when in the past the main engagement was simple bank books, and bank accounts for students, now it is about the day to day and even school offerings being transacted upon with their technology. 
 
 ## Recommendations 
 * If you were a consultant, or adviser to Spriggy what products or services would you suggest they offer?  
 1.  I believe that further development into blockchain and bitcoin offerings would allow this product to expand both nationally and globally.  By eliminating the problem of foreign exchange, and accepting bitcoin and building payment structures on blockchain I believe that Spriggy could become universally successful. 
 * Why do you think offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
 1. Currently they are limited to a payment solution based on the domestic currency of the jurisdiction they operate in.  As such, I believe that financial education, and literacy, and simplified earning and spending set ups for younger people is a worldwide phenomenon.  By being able to tap into intially other western nations and then go from there could drastically enhance the business valuation. 
 * What techonologies would this additional product or service utilise? 
 1. Blockchain and Bitcoin as well as web3, or other cloud based offerings.  
 * Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 
 1. Firstly blockchain can offer a peer-to-peer secure network, and I believe that a family could engage grandparents, and uncles etc that are involved in a child's development to all utilise the technology to share financial knowledge, or understanding, and also assist a child with savings, and help them to understand the value of work for gain.  Distributed ledger technology could bring about greater transactional speed, and transparency, thus creating a more user friendly solution.
